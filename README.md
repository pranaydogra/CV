# CV

My Curriculum Vitae.

I’m and immunologist with a strong background in T- and NK-cell biology and have significant experience in implementation of bioinformatics techniques for the analysis of high-dimensional datasets. I want to integrate my knowledge of virology, immunology, and my programming skills to develop a research program that is focused on the development of new and more potent cell-based immunotherapies.

Let's connect.
